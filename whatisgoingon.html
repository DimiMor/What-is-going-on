    <h3 class="article">Well here I go with my first thought about behaviors. How people deal with comments and opinions in the social media. <br> That is a real thing nowadays, because everyone like to share their opinion about everything. The major problem is that a lot of those people are going to far when it comes to what to say it and how to say it.<br> What I realized is that people sometimes say things they would never do it in a face-to-face situation. I really believe that if we keep the discussion in those terms, the social media will lose credibility, and people who really want to share opinions or try to show theirs side of an history, will just stop to do it in the social media. So, to change this we need to start to take the debates more seriously. First thing is, do not say anything that you wouldn’t if you were facing the third party. Try to not banalize the discussion making jokes or cursing. <br> Change this behavior will bring just benefits to everyone. <br> But the most important thing is to never allow people to let you down because they are saying bad things online.<br><br>Jun 22,2020</h3>

    <h3 class="article">The last few months one of the things we hear all the time, everywhere, is: "Keep social distance”.<br> How difficult is it to follow this instruction? I will tell you that it seems pretty hard, because in my opinion this is the point that almost every country is losing the war against Covid19…. <br> But if we stop to think, it’s really hard to do it. The humankind was made to stay together, to help each other to survive in the hostile nature environment. Imagine if we ask to a pack of wolves to not stay together…. They will die.<br>Wille the vaccine for Covid19 doesn’t come, we need to go against our nature and practice the social distance, even that is not easy, but is what we have now, and to spare lives we will find a way, at least until a vaccine comes.<br><br>Jul 28,2020</h3>

    <h3 class="article">Why some parents are so scared when they need to say NO to their kids? <br> Every father and mother should know that deal with NO is very important for the future of any children. If as a parent you don’t teach them how to leave with the frustration sometimes, I can tell you when they grow up their life will not be easy… When you see a kid crying out loud in a grocery store because the mother/father is not buying what they want, you know that child doesn’t deal well when something is denied.<br>Of course you can not say NO to everything, otherwise the children are going to see themselves as not capable to try new things and bee creative.<br> Actually the biggest challenge for most of the parent nowadays is to know how to balance the situation… But I still think that in the majority of the cases they are losing this fight. What happen is that Mom and Dad are scared to say NO and make their kids sad or to have an overreaction coming from them.<br> So, must of the time you know what is wrong or right, take the leadership of the relationship and start to educate your kids for the world, knowing how to deal with the NO.<br><br>Aug 11,2020</h3>

    <h3 class="article">I think that not just for me, but for many of you guys, this is one of the best movies and trilogy (although the 3rd one is not wonderful) of all time. The script is amazing, giving you a very good picture when Italians first came to North America, and how they created the criminal organizations to be able to support the family and make money. It also shows how the families took over the neighborhoods criminal business creating the mob. <br>Other strong point of the film is the soundtrack, where it fits primordially with the environment and decade that the movie is situated. <br>Perhaps the highest point of the films are the performances (except for the 3 one) of the main characters and supporting actors. It seems that they were created for those roles, and that is so true that many of them never had the same success and level of performance again.<br> So if you never watched the 3 movies before, you already now what to do the next weekend, if you already did, just do it again.<br><br>Jul 15,2020</h3>

    <h3 class="article">Well what can I say about this movie…. The first thing is, no man can compete against Maximus Decimus Meridius. The guy was a wonderful husband and dad, a perfect general, and I will not even talk about his fight skills…<br> Beside that, the movies is very good. You can see a little bit about Roman empire, the visual effects are amazing, and the fights and battles are just mind blowing…. You also have Joaquin Phenix showing how good he can be as actor and Russel Crow is also a good choice for his rule.<br> When comes to soundtrack this movie used Classic music in the battles and most of the scenes, what was precisely done. <br> In my opinion is one of the most well made movies about the Roman empire, it doesn’t show a lot of the historical expansion of the empire, but it shows a bit of the political system, what is the pillar for most of the systems that we have right know.<br> So go forward for this one!!!<br><br>Jul 30, 2020</h3>

    <h3 class="article">If you are waiting for the new Game of Throne books, I can tell you this one could be a very tiny peace of satisfaction. The story is well connected, but it doesn’t go until the generation the we had one the GOT books, what for me is bad, because I really would like to see more about the last two Targarian generations to connect with the recent GOT events .<br> Despite that it’s not a bad reading, if you are a GOT lover you are going to have fun.<br>One thing is very different about the kind of reading is that The Fire and Blood is not happing in real time, is more like someone telling historical facts from different data collected. And, at least for me, one of the better things about GOT is to hoe the author shows the different views of each main character.<br> Based on everything the book brings to you I think is a nice entertainment, so…. Go for it and read!!<br><br>Aug 04,2020</h3>

    <h3 class="critica-shog">The book I am about to comment now is Shogun, it can be a  little old, but the story it’s fantastic. <br>Based on real events, the book takes place in the mid-1500dc, and it tells the events of when the first English vessel arrived in Japan. <br>One of the coolest points of the book is the description of Japanese society and its way of life. Looking back, we can really identify why Japan is such a disciplined country with such well-structured technology and society. <br>One other highlight is how the Japanese face natural adversity, because living in a small country and with an instable nature, they had to shape their customs to survive and prosper. <br> Religion also played an important role in social and individual behavior. Life and events were focused on the present and the future was the consequence of the acts. <br>Thinking in this way they always were busy in making a good planning, and even more importantly an excellent execution, never losing focus on the present. <br>I'm saying it again, excellent book, with great teachings.<br><br>Jun 23,2020</h3>

    <h3 class="article">Do you know the feeling when you see a project coming and you think: “This will be awesome!!”. Yes, I had this feeling with The Witcher. The reality was way far from what I expected. The production is good, but when come to script, it was a real mess. They tried to show different times in the story to merge everything in one, but in my opinion, it was not well done. The actors I would not say the was a disappointment because I was not expecting nothing good, especially coming from Henry Cavill. The support actors also didn’t show nothing special. So, they took a good story very popular in the pop culture and did a weak project, expensive but weak. I will give one more chance and watch the second season, but it will be the last one. I think you can do the same…<br><br>Jul 15,2020</h3>

    <h3 class="article">For those who think that the show is only one of those stories about magical beings and creatures, I can tell you are totally wrong.<br>In fact the series talks about a subject super updated and polemic, which is the difference of races and prejudice around this theme.<br> Situated in something like London of the Victorian era , the script shows the marginalization of some races, where creating a tense and violent environment (what is not so different of ours reality), where the lower races are treated as inferior and with violence.<br> The performance is not the strongest point of the series, we can say that some actors are doing good and others not so good .<br> Script and production super cool, because the viewer is trapped by the plots of fast resolution , but there is a bigger plot that is still open leaving the hook for second season, which is already in production.<br> It's worth it!!!<br><br>Aug 11,2020</h3>
